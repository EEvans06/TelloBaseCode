## Tello-Drone

#### *This Repository will contain the source code for Tello which is the name of the drone I am going to use for educational purposes. I am working with Python and a few lirbraries to suit the Tello Drone and operate it correctly. I am also learning a little bit more of Python in the process to improve under a short time frame.*

* djitellopy
* pygame
* cv2

Install normally if you use pip
```
    pip install djitellopy
